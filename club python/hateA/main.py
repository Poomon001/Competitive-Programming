# 0. if the input is a(s) then we imidately return t
# 1. use a loop...in to remove all a charachalf of the string t after I removed aters in string t
# 2. slicing first half and second
# 3. compare first half and second half: if first == second then the out put will return second half
#                                      : if the first != second then no solution, we return the sad face ":("
# **4. if s' contain "a' then return ":("  --> very tricky because I did not realize that s' can contain a (contradict the problem precondition)

    Purpose :t=s+sâ€²; t, s and s' are string.  given a string t. Find some s that could have used to generate t.
    Input: sting - contains alphabet characters
    Print: string - s
    Pre-Condition : the input string is not empty and lowercase
    Post-Condition: none
